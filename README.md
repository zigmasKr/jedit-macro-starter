# jedit-macro-starter
Macro 'starter' for jEdit written in Javascript (Nashorn).
Work started on 2017-01-03 with a launcher of the Perl script articledata.pl.
The main work is done within that Perl script.
Next step was in 2018-07 when a tool for QC procedures was created on a new tab.
This tool demonstrates the use of zip (unzip *bz.2 files in atree), PDF reader, 
jEdit, and its plugin JDiff on a number of files.
