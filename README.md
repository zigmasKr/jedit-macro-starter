# jedit-macro-starter
Macro 'starter' for jEdit written in Javascript (Nashorn).
Work started on 2017-01-03 with a launcher of the Perl script articledata.pl.
The main work is done within that Perl script.
Next step was in 2018-07 when a tool for QC procedures was created on a new tab.
This tool demonstrates the use of zip (unzip *.bz2 files in a tree), Adobe PDF reader, 
jEdit, and its plugin JDiff on a number of files. OS: Windows 7.
2019-09-29: The QC Tool part has now the button "Next Item" and related add-ons.
The script version, named starter-fnc.js is for use in the plugin "Nashorn Function".
